Bug reports in a repository are generally organized line by line in a list-view, with their titles and other meta-data displayed. In this list-view, a concise and precise title plays an important role that enables project practitioners to quickly and correctly digest the core idea of the bug, without carefully reading the corresponding details. However, the quality of bug report titles varies in open-source communities, which may be due to the limited time and unprofessionalism of authors. To help report authors efficiently draft good-quality titles, we propose a method, named iTAPE, to automatically generate titles for their bug reports. iTAPE formulates title generation into a one-sentence summarization task. By properly tackling two domain-specific challenges (i.e. lacking off-the-shelf dataset and handling the low-frequency human-named tokens), iTAPE then generates titles using a Seq2Seq-based model. A comprehensive experimental study shows that iTAPE can obtain fairly satisfactory results, in terms of the comparison with three latest one-sentence summarization works, as well as the feedback from human evaluation.
Bug report plays a vital role in software development. It can record every observed unexpected behavior of the software or request new features to enhance the current version. The quality of bug reports has been widely concerned and studied by both industry and academia because low-quality reports are generally considered to bring difficulties in bug understanding [5, 47], reproducing [3], tracking [24], triage [44, 48], fixing [7, 15] and etc. A great number of works have been done to improve the bug report quality. In practice, a commonly adopted method is to provide a report template, in which every field has its guideline to fill in. For example, Mozilla provides bug report guidelines for developers to follow¹.
In these commonly adopted guidelines, the title of a bug report, which is one of the compulsory fields, generally requires to summarize the bug as precisely and concisely as possible. For instance, a professional testing and QA platform, testlio, requires that “Your title should serve as a concise summary of what the bug is”². Similar requirements can be found in Mozilla bug report guidelines: “Writing a clear summary: How would you describe the bug using approximately 10 words? This is the first part of your bug report a triager or developer will see. A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report.”

For open-source communities, such as GitHub, concerns on the quality of bug reports are even greater, because they usually receive submissions of bug reports from various levels of practitioners. (In GitHub, “issues” play the same role as bug reports, thus in this paper, we will use issue and bug report interchangeably). As a consequence, we can see many open-source projects give their “contribution guidelines”, which explicitly require the compulsory fields in the issue. Nowadays, we have seen open-source practitioners are getting more serious about the bodies of their submitted issues. However, it seems that the quality of the issue titles has not received enough attention. For example, the issue of Case A in Table 1 has an acceptable body, but its title only contains four words and barely conveys any useful information, except for indicating that a module does not work. In contrast, an alternative like “TensorFlow GPU requires CUDA >= 3.5 instead of described 3.0 in instructions” would be much more clear and informative.

Such phenomena are not uncommon. The possible reasons could be various. For example, it could be due to the tight time schedule of the project, which pushes developers and testers to give top priority to the report body and finally have to submit an ad-hoc title due to the limited time. Or, it might be due to the limited professionalism of the external contributors who are not capable to summarize the issues precisely and concisely. After all, for novice practitioners, it may not be difficult to fill in the required issue template, but it could be non-trivial to write a title for the issue in a professional manner.

In fact, the quality of the issue title is as important as the quality of the issue body. A good title can properly summarize the core idea from the details of the issue. It can help project maintainers quickly comprehend the issue, such that they can assign proper labels, setting priorities, or formulate a suitable bug triage strategy, more efficiently. A concise and precise summary of the issue may also be helpful in quickly reminding practitioners about other similar issues, with which some fixing solutions may be referenced or reused³. In contrast, an ad-hoc title with nearly no information, or too much noisy information, will force practitioners to spend more time digesting the details in the body. When crammed with a pile of issues with ad-hoc titles, quickly sorting out their topics, categories, priorities, etc., becomes very difficult.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method, iTAPE, to automatically generate titles for issues. iTAPE formulates title generation into a one-sentence summarization task as those commonly adopted guidelines suggest, and solves it with a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model since the Seq2Seq-based model is proper for such a token sequence transformation task where the lengths of the source and target sequences are different [38]. As a reminder, in this task, there is no existing dataset with pure good-quality titled bug reports as the learning source and benchmark. Moreover, the low term-frequency of human-named tokens (such as identifiers and version numbers) caused by their flexible spelling also makes the general RNN-based Seq2Seq model that depends on repeatedly learning within a fixed vocabulary fail on these tokens. iTAPE tackles these two challenges by (i) using three heuristic rules to collect suitable samples from open-source projects to form the dataset; and (ii) adopting the Copy Mechanism together with a newly proposed method named human-named token tagging. We conduct comprehensive experiments and have found that iTAPE can deliver satisfactory results. Specifically, as compared with three latest methods on general title generation tasks, iTAPE can obtain a comparable result on our task. The ablation study demonstrates the helpfulness from sub-components of iTAPE in addressing the above challenges. In addition, we conduct a human evaluation, in which iTAPE receives fairly positive feedback from the volunteers.

The benefits of using iTAPE are three-fold. First, it allows practitioners to focus on drafting the report body; while leaving the title generation jobs to be done automatically. This can help to save time and meet the tight time schedule; meanwhile without sacrificing the title quality. Secondly, iTAPE enables novice external contributors to submit issue titles in a professional style. As a consequence, the title style in the project can be highly consistent, which is beneficial to project maintenance. Thirdly, iTAPE can be used on legacy projects. It is widely known that data in legacy projects may have huge hidden values; however, these data could also be very “messy” and “dirty”, and hence too expensive to process. iTAPE can be helpful, in terms of screening historical issues and rectifying those low-quality titles into consistent professional style, automatically.

In summary, this work makes the following contributions:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the automatic issue title generation and propose a Seq2Seq summarization based method, iTAPE, to realize this.
• We propose three heuristic rules to refine samples for both training and evaluating issue title generation methods, with which the first benchmark dataset is constructed for the entire task.
• We propose a light-weight “tagging” method, combined with Copy Mechanism, to help model effectively process the low-frequency human-named tokens during the title generation.
• We conduct a comprehensive experimental study, including both quantitative comparison and human evaluation. The results show that iTAPE can obtain a comparable result as latest one-sentence summarization works in ROUGE scores and generate relatively good issue titles in most situations.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the motivating examples, the problem formulation, and two domain-specific challenges of our task. Section 3 elaborates the details of our method, iTAPE, and the solutions we design for the two challenges. Section 4 and Section 5 describe the settings and the results of the experiment to evaluate the performance of iTAPE, respectively. After that, Section 6 analyzes the threats to validity and Section 7 discusses some related works. Finally, Section 8 draws a conclusion and gives ideas on future work.
